## Lecture 33 - STL Containers
* Container library is a collection of classes
* The containers are implemented as generic class templates.
* Containers help us to implement and replicate simple and complex data structurs very easily like arrays, list, trees, associative arrays and many more.
* Containers con be used to hold different kind of objects.
### Common Containers
* `vector`: replicates arrays
* `queue` : replicates queues
* `stack` : replicates stack
* `priority_queue`: replicates heaps
* `list`: replicates linked list
* `set` : replicates trees
* `map` : associative arrays
### Classifications of containers
* Sequence Containers
    * `array`, `linked list` etc
* Asscociative Containers
    * Soted Data structure like `map`, `set` etc
* Unordered Accociative containers
    * Unsorted Data sturcture
* Containers Adapters
    * Interfaces to sequence containers
