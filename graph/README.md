## Terminologies

-   vertices/edges: graph is a collection of edges and vertices
-   bidirectional/unidirectional edges
-   tree: tree is a graph that has no cycle
-   connected components
-   undirected/directed graphs
-   directed acyclic graph
-   directed cyclic graph
-   strongly connected component
-   graph forest
-   root/child/parents/leaf nude in tree
-   height/depth in tree
-   lowest common ancestor (lca)

## Equation

-   if tree has `n` nodes then it has `n - 1` edges
