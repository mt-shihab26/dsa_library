# Lecture 32 Introduction to STL
* STL is Standard Template Library
* It is a powerful set of C++ template classes
* At the core of the C++ Standard Template Library are following four well-structured components
    * Containers
    * Iterators
    * Algorithms
    * Functions
## Containers
* Containers are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind.
* Conatiner library in STL provide containers that used to create datat structures like arrays, linked list, trees etc.
* These container are generic, they can hold elements of any data types.
## Algorithms
* Algorithms act on containers. They provide the means by which you will perform initialization, sorting, searching and transforming of the contents of containers.
* Algorithms library cotains built in functions that performs complex algorithms on the data structures.
* Algoritm library provides abstraction, i.e you don't necessarily need to know how the algoritms works.
## Iterators
* Iterators are used to step through the elements of collection of objects. These collection my be containers or subsets of containers.
* Iterators is STL are used to point to the cotainers
* Iterators actually acts as a bridge betweeen containers and algorithms.
