# Notes

## Language

- Data Types
  - `int` `-10^9 -> 10^9`
  - `long long int` `-10^18 -> 10^18`
- OJ Time Limits
  - Number of iterations in 1 second is : `10^7 to 10^8`
  - if, `10^7 -> 1 second`
  - `10^8 -> 10 seconds`
  - `10^9 -> 100 seconds`
  - `10^10 -> 1000 seconds`
  - `10^11 -> 10000 seconds`
- Array Size
  - Global Array Size: `10^7`
  - Local Array Size: `10^5`
